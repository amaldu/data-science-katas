The t-test is designed for **continuous metrics** (like average revenue). Since our metric is a proportion (conversion rate), the Z-test is the natural fit.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic **guardrail metric** scenario. It could mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The new design attracts low-value conversions**: Maybe the simpler checkout reduces friction for small purchases but doesn't help larger ones.\n",
    "2. **Cannibalization**: Users might be buying cheaper items instead of browsing more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I'd do:**\n",
    "- Segment the analysis by user type, purchase amount, and product category\n",
    "- Calculate **total revenue impact** (conversion rate x average order value x traffic)\n",
    "- If net revenue is negative despite higher conversion, **do not launch**\n",
    "- Consider if the OEC (Overall Evaluation Criterion) should be revenue rather than conversion rate"
