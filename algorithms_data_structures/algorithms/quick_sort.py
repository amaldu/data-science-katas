# This sorting algorithm is recursive. 
# 1. It divides the list into 2 sublists (left and right) keeping the value used to divide them, isolated. 
# This value is called pivot
# The behaviour in the next steps happens symmetrically on both branches with the sublists but 
# we only describe what happens to the left sublist.
# 2. On the left sublist it applies the same algorithm that keeps the central value and divides the sublist
# again into two subsublists (left and right). 
# 3. It sorts the subsublists and sends them back to create the sublist.
# 4. The sublists are ordered and sent back to the list.

# Runtime is O(nÂ²)
